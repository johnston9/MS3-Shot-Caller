  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The site aims to be minimal streamlined and slick using an offblack background 
      colour with blue side image panels and an offwhite text. Crimson and blue tones
      are used minimally against this for a touch of sophisticated flare especially
      the site title in crimson letters running downwards on either side of the header box.

  
  - #### Typography
    - Materialize was used for the site and I kept their inherent font-family style 
      choice with was: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, 
      Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu,Cantarell, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif. This worked perfectly
      for the style of the site.


  - #### Imagery
    - The site was designed to have a minimal straight to business slick slightly cinematic look. This was achieved
      by the use of right and reversed left narrow side panels on an offblack background.
      The panels contain an images of a narrow window and it's blue lighting
      effect which act as a foreground to the complementing seemingly distant dark header box
      container which also has one of the images to which focus is drawn. The hope is that
      this achieves a feeling of cinematic lighting and depth.

  - #### Wireframes

    - PDF â€“ Balsamic was used to design the layout for login, register, user base, 
      dep messages, images, and the add and admin upload pages.
